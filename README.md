# DMTFroyoRepository
I got help for this project during lab hours, I would've been unable to come up with the code I used on my own.  It's largely (the object part) from Katie's code, she did a really good job.  I've put in comments to try and break down what everything does, since it's a bit reductive for me to just use someone else's code and learn nothing from it (not to mention generally bad practice in life).  I would've preferred to be able to come up with something from scratch, with no help, but I'm not yet skilled enough to do that, so I think learning how it all works and internalizing it for my own work is the next best thing I can do. So I believe I understand how she did it, and I'm going to make my own and add it as an alternative to this file before next class to assuage my anxiety and need to be able to do it myself.
